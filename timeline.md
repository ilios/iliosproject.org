## Current Roadmap

> (_2023_ - _2025_ : _Community engagement; next-generation planning and preparation; enhanced preferences and analytics_)\
> (_2024_ - _2028_ : Extend robust analytics, search, and visualization capabilities within the platform, as well as for integration with third party tools, including AI-assisted enhancements)

Since we began the Ilios Project in 2009, we have journeyed through multiple phases of growth and development. Beginning in 2015, we moved into the next critical phase of growth. During the expected initial 7-year lifecycle of version 3 (2016-2023), we extended and improved the application platform for mobility, interoperability and visibility of data across the spectrum of the educational ecosystem. As of this writing, we are approaching the ninth year of life for version 3, and expect to see at least four more years of the stable version 3 platform before reviewing needs for a major revision and version update.

We expect to see significant enhancements to the existing reporting tools in 2025, as well as more robust and interactive visualizations for mapping; we also look to have global search including the content of digital learning materials by 2026, and to be able to integrate secure AI / LLM toolkits to provide support for deep analytics and CQI efforts.

## Ilios - The Tool

As of the late 2015 release of version 3 of Ilios, we have begun extending the application to meet the rapidly changing needs of the health professions community in the 21<sup>st</sup> century. Building on and extending the capacity of the published curriculum standards designed for the 2011 - 2022 AAMC Curriculum Inventory, and leveraging the capabilities of current technology APIs to simplify communication across disparate systems, we look to provide ongoing and increasing support for complex competency based curricular models, for clinical and experiential learning modalities, and provide ever greater flexibility for interprofessional education. As Ilios continues to grow, we intend to provide the most effective mechanisms available in curriculum management for IPE, EPAs, Mapping, and the support clinical and other complex modalities of learning.

## Ilios - The Community

Along with the continuing adoption of Ilios by professional schools across the globe, and partnerships with other premier schools, we continue to expand and improve the open source community of users, contributors, and leaders for Ilios. Our continuing goal is for the community to be self-supporting, continually growing, technically active, and widely distributed.
